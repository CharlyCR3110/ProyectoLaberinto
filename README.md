### Data Structures Project - Maze Generator and Solver

This project is part of the EIF207 - Data Structures course at the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica, developed during the second cycle of the year 2023 under the guidance of Professor M.Sc. Georges Alfaro S.

## Problem Statement
The project's main goal is to create a desktop application that allows the generation and exploration of mazes, as well as the management of documents for storage and retrieval.

## Project Objectives
The focus is on studying graph representation techniques and basic algorithms, particularly the use of backtracking programming. The application must be properly structured.

## Project Description
- The application will generate random mazes using either the Prim's algorithm or a variation of Kruskal's algorithm.
- The user can switch the maze visualization between division lines and solid walls.
- Each maze is saved in XML format, allowing for opening and retrieval.

## Program Operation
- The program will allow opening, saving, and generating mazes of arbitrary size.
- A table in the main window will display information about the open mazes.
- The user can manually navigate the maze or request the program to solve it automatically.

## Implementation Considerations
- The program will be developed in Java using the Swing library for the graphical interface.
